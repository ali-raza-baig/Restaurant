## Components

Components are the building blocks of the application. They are categorized based on the pages they belong to. Common components are those that are reused across multiple pages.

## Layouts

Layouts are used to structure the overall layout of the pages. The `MainLayout` component, for instance, might include the header, footer, and any other common elements that are present on all pages.

## Pages

Pages represent the different views of the application. Each page corresponds to a specific route and is composed of various components and layouts.

## Routing

React Router DOM is used for client-side routing. The routes are defined in `App.js` and include paths for the home page, franchise page, about page, cart page, checkout page, and menu page.

## Styling

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the components. Tailblock and Flowbite provide pre-designed components that are used throughout the project to ensure a consistent and modern design.
